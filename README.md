The Chess Project
![alt text]('c:\Users\Ryan\Pictures\project 1.png')

This is my chess game for my end-of-year(currently unavailable due to work required)

This is also a solo project

The story of the project is starting on another project I had in mind, a turn-by-turn strategy game really ambitious(secrets items and enemies, terrain advantages, etc...).I planned it but I realized I was venturing on Unity for my first time AND with a new language.I looked on a forum than a good starting point would be a chess game so that's where this idea came from.
