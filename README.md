The Chess Project

![project 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91030070/199517401-63ea07ca-a179-4ad4-889a-9f0a5edec2ba.png)


This is my chess game for my end-of-year(currently unavailable due to work required)

This is also a solo project

The story of the project is starting on another project I had in mind, a turn-by-turn strategy game really ambitious(secrets items and enemies, terrain advantages, etc...).I planned it but I realized I was venturing on Unity for my first time AND with a new language.I looked on a forum than a good starting point would be a chess game so that's where this idea came from.
