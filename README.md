The Chess Project

![project 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91030070/199517401-63ea07ca-a179-4ad4-889a-9f0a5edec2ba.png)


This is my chess game for my end-of-year(currently unavailable due to work required)
It should also work on phone(update asap)

This is also a solo project

The story of the project is starting on another project I had in mind, a turn-by-turn strategy game really ambitious(secrets items and enemies, terrain advantages, etc...).I planned it but I realized I was venturing on Unity for my first time AND with a new language.I looked on a forum than a good starting point would be a chess game so that's where this idea came from.

The code of the project is divided in three parts:
The game (which handle how the game works

The chessman (which handles the mechanics of the game)

and the Moveplate (which handle the moveplates used for attacking and moving)

I used C# because it is the most used language in Unity and I used mostly codes for my project since it is my first on this platform
I know that my code can be more optimised and new features are planned(raising of checks(it's not present currently), roques, battle animations, choice of color(choice of turn, fixing blurry sprites)).Currently,the sprites are changed to the ones in the game Advance Wars.
